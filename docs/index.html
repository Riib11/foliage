      <h3>About Foliage</h3>
      <p>Introducing a new programming language paradigm called "fixed-point oriented programming". This new kind of
        programming is based on computing mathematical fixed-points over lattice-ordered domains.</p>

      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>This allows you to write fixed-point style algorithms as a system of rules, which is a much more concise,
        understandable, and modular style of implementation as compared to iterative or recursive styles.</p>
